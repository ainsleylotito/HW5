#HW5

To explore homicides in Baton Rouge and create a map of solved vs. unsolved homicides, open **HW5.Rmd** in the subdirectory /writing. 

Data used for the analysis is contained inside the /data subdirectory, 
in the file "homicide-data.csv". Data was accessed from the Washington Post's Github page at 
"https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides". 

*Information on the dataset from the Washington Post: *
"The Washington Post collected data on more than 52,000 criminal homicides over the past decade in 50 of the largest American cities.
The data included the location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in most cases, basic demographic information about each victim.
Reporters received data in many formats, including paper, and worked for months to clean and standardize it, comparing homicide counts and aggregate closure rates with FBI data to ensure the records were as accurate as possible.
In some cases, departments provided only partial information about the homicides, so reporters consulted public records, including death certificates, court records and medical examiner reports, to fill in the gaps. The data is more specific than the federal homicide data gathered annually by the FBI from police agencies nationwide.
The Post mapped each homicide, identifying arrest rates by geography in each city, sharing the analysis with the local police department prior to publication."
